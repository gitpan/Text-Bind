SUMMARY

Text::Bind allows you to bind Perl structures (strings, routines,
filehandles, objects, and arrays) to specific locations (called *data
sites*) in text files.

The main purpose of this module is to support HTML templates for
CGI programs. Therefore, HTML pages design can be kept separate from
CGI code. However, the class is general enough to be used in other
contexts than CGI application development.
